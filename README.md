# Loan Default Prediction

Being successful in assessing the risk of loan applicants more accurately enables loan providers to better price customers and control losses on their portfolio of loans. In this project, I will predict the loan risk or quality of loan repayment on a given applicant.

## Context
```payment.ipynb``` is the working file to clean and transform the payment data. Later on, this dataset is used in the ```loan.ipynb```.

Note: Raw data won't be shared due to confidentiality.
